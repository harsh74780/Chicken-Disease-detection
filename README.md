# Chicken-Disease-detection
This project detects coccidiosis in poultry using deep learning and computer vision with the EfficientNet model. It classifies chicken fecal matter as healthy or affected, providing an accessible, accurate method for early disease detection. This can save costs and improve animal health management in the poultry industry.
